## 🜂 A Brief Note About Me  
I’m in my third year of CSE (Data Science), still exploring, still shaping my direction —  
but with a constant thread running through everything I do:

**I don’t learn things to finish them.  
I learn things to understand them.**

Whether it’s  
- a DSA pattern I'm trying to see behind the syntax,  
- a ML model whose behaviour I want to explain instead of memorize,  
- a cybersecurity problem that feels like a puzzle of human behaviour,  
- or an abstract idea of how AI systems might influence the OS we depend on…  

…I always dig until the concept starts talking back.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **logic, systems, and imagination** —  
a place where engineering meets intuition.

## 🜁 How I Learn (and Unlearn)  
Most days, I’m doing one of these three things:  
1. **Understanding fundamentals deeply** — DSA, ML, AI, Cybersecurity, Cloud  
2. **Breaking things on purpose** — small experiments, edge cases, odd ideas  
3. **Asking myself: “Where could this be applied in the future?”**

I don't rush to finish projects;  
I let them evolve with my understanding.  
Some stay unfinished on purpose — because unfinished things teach differently.

## 🜄 What I’m Currently Exploring  
- The “why” behind algorithms instead of the “how”  
- ML models as decision systems, not just accuracy numbers  
- Data as a behavioural signal, not a spreadsheet  
- Cybersecurity as storytelling — attackers leave patterns  
- Cloud as an environment to scale thought experiments  
- And AI as a tool to extend human reasoning  

I'm not trying to master everything at once.  
I'm trying to understand everything **enough to connect them**.

## 🜁 Tools & Technologies I Use  
*(Not as badges to show off — but as mediums I think through.)*

**Languages:** Python, C, C++, Java, SQL  
**Data / ML:** NumPy, pandas, sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Cyber / Systems:** Wireshark, APIs, OS internals (research)  
**Analytics / BI:** Power BI, Excel  
**Dev / Cloud:** Git, GitHub Actions, AWS fundamentals, Linux  

These aren’t checkboxes.  
They’re the tools that currently help me think clearer.

## 🜃 Things I Build  
I’ve kept my projects visible on my profile — ML, DS, Cyber, Analytics, and a bit of system-level research.  
Some are polished, some are experiments, some are in progress.

Every project carries a small signature of how I think:  
**analytical, structured, and a little abstract.**

---

## 🜁 Why I’m Here on GitHub  
To track how I grow.  
To document how I think.  
To experiment in public.  
To leave small traces of originality in a field filled with templates.  
To build systems that make sense — and systems that make me question things.

If my work resonates with you, feel free to explore.  
If it doesn’t, that’s okay — it’s meant to be personal before it becomes public.
