## Hello, I'm Madhusmita

- I build systems that think, learn, defend, and scale._  
---

## About Me
- I’m a 3rd-year CSE student working across  
**AI · ML · Cybersecurity · Cloud · Data Science**  
to create systems that are fast, aware, and reliable.
I like clean logic, meaningful systems, and ideas that grow into tools.  
I choose clarity over noise, originality over trends,
and impact over aesthetics — while still caring about aesthetics.

## What I Do    
- Work with structured/unstructured data pipelines  
- Build ML models that predict, detect, adapt
- Analyse data and convert chaos → clarity
- Create AI-driven threat-intelligence workflows
- Work with structured/unstructured data pipelines 
- Push abstract ideas until they turn into usable technology
