## 👋 About Me
I’m a third-year CSE (Data Science) student who learns by understanding concepts at their core and applying them to real problems.  
I explore ideas across ML, data, security, cloud, and system behaviour — building small projects, running experiments, and improving my fundamentals along the way.

## 🔍 What I'm Focused On
- Strengthening **DSA** for clarity & problem solving  
- Building ML models with proper data handling  
- Understanding how AI interacts with systems & security  
- Learning AWS fundamentals  
- Turning ideas into structured, reproducible projects

## 📂 How I Work
I like to explore ideas practically — understand the concept, try it, build something around it, refine it, and repeat.  
Every project here reflects that process.
